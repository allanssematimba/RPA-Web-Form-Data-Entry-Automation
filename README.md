# RPA-Web-Form-Data-Entry-Automation

This project demonstrates how to use the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) module to automate data entry tasks on a website. The RPA module allows you to automate repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up your time to focus on more strategic and high-value activities.

In this project, we will use the RPA module to read data from an Excel file, perform data entry operations on a web page, and capture the results. We will also demonstrate how to take screenshots of the web page and save them for future reference.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need to install the RPA module using pip:
pip install rpa


You will also need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.

## Usage
To run the automation script, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the RPA module and its dependencies using pip.
- Install any necessary drivers for the web browser you plan to use.
- Create an Excel file with the data you want to enter into the web page.
- Update the script with the path to your Excel file and any other necessary information.
- Run the script using the following command:
python rpa_data_entry.py


The script will automatically navigate to the web page, enter the data from your Excel file, and save a screenshot of the results.
